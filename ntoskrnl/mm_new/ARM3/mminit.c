/* The memory layout (and especially variable names) of the NT kernel mode components
   can be a bit hard to twig, especially when it comes to the non paged area.

   There are really two components to the non-paged pool:
   - The initial nonpaged pool, sized dynamically up to a maximum.
   - The expansion nonpaged pool, sized dynamically up to a maximum.

   The initial nonpaged pool is physically continuous for performance,
   and immediately follows the PFN database, typically sharing the same PDE.
   It is a very small resource (32MB on a 1GB system), and capped at 128MB.

   Right now we call this the "ARM3 Nonpaged Pool"
   and it begins somewhere after the PFN database (which starts at 0xB0000000).

   The expansion nonpaged pool, on the other hand, can grow much bigger (400MB for a 1GB system).
   On ARM3 however, it is currently capped at 128MB.

   The address where the initial nonpaged pool starts is aptly named MmNonPagedPoolStart,
   and it describes a range of MmSizeOfNonPagedPoolInBytes bytes.

   Expansion nonpaged pool starts at an address described by the variable called MmNonPagedPoolExpansionStart,
   and it goes on for MmMaximumNonPagedPoolInBytes minus MmSizeOfNonPagedPoolInBytes bytes,
   always reaching MmNonPagedPoolEnd (because of the way it's calculated) at 0xFFBE0000.

   Initial nonpaged pool is allocated and mapped early-on during boot, but what about the expansion nonpaged pool?
   It is instead composed of special pages which belong to what are called System PTEs.
   These PTEs are the matter of a later discussion, but they are also considered part of the "nonpaged" OS,
   due to the fact that they are never paged out -- once an address is described by a System PTE,
   it is always valid, until the System PTE is torn down.

   System PTEs are actually composed of two "spaces", the system space proper, and the nonpaged pool expansion space.
   The latter, as we've already seen, begins at MmNonPagedPoolExpansionStart.
   Based on the number of System PTEs that the system will support,
   the remaining address space below this address is used to hold the system space PTEs.
   This address, in turn, is held in the variable named MmNonPagedSystemStart,
   which itself is never allowed to go below 0xEB000000 (thus creating an upper bound on the number of System PTEs).

   This means that 330MB are reserved for total nonpaged system VA,
   on top of whatever the initial nonpaged pool allocation is.
